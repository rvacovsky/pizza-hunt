# Pizza Hunt üçï

## Description

Pizza Hunt is a web application that allows users to post pizza recipes, see others' contributions, comment on posts, and reply to comments.

## User Story

As a pizza aficionado, I want a social media application that allows me to connect with other pizza lovers and share our favorite pizza combinations. I want to be able to post my toppings combinations and comment on others' pizza posts.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user enters the app, they land on a page with all app user recipe contributions. Each recipe features a pizza name, size, and list of toppings. The recipe also features the username of who created it, and is timestamped to when they submitted the recipe.

The user can create a new pizza, which opens a new page to collect the Pizza Name, the Username, and the Pizza Size. The user can then check boxes on any pizza toppings listed or can free text their own toppings in. Once all fields have been completed, they may submit their recipe to the app, which will post along with the other recipes. If the user does not list the pizza title or their name they will receive an error. If a user is offline, the app will still allow them to submit a recipe. This recipe will appear after the user comes back online.

The user may also comment on other user recipe posts. The user may also reply to a comment when another user posts a comment to their recipe.
